## *Functional Multi-Reference Alignment: A Framework with Fourier Neural Operator and Bispectrum-Guided Diffusion Posteriors*

This repository contains the implementation of my ongoing research project: *Functional Multi-Reference Alignment: A Framework with Fourier Neural Operator and Bispectrum-Guided Diffusion Posteriors*. This work is conducted under the supervision of **Prof. Daniel Sanz-Alonso**.

The project is actively under development, and the codebase will continue to be updated and refined. Please check back regularly for improvements, additional features, and reproducible experiment pipelines.

### Work in progress

* Additional experiments and benchmarks
* Extended 2D functional MRA support (2D FNO implementation complete; focusing on posterior sampling)
* Implementation of Neumann and Periodic boundary conditions
* Improved bispectrum estimators
* More robust training and sampling workflows
